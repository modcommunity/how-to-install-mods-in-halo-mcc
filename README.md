## Game Version Notes
Modding support is officially enabled in **Steam** builds of Halo: MCC. You can access mod tools for each title via the "Mod Tools" DLC in your Steam Library.

A couple of notes regarding Microsoft Store/Game Pass users:

* Modding is not officially supported, and modifying files can break the game or violate the terms of service.
* It's highly recommended to use the **Steam version** for modding purposes.

## Backup Your Game Files!
Before installing any mods, we strongly recommend backing up your game files to avoid corruption or problems during online gameplay.

To back up your game files, please follow these steps.

1. Go to your Steam installation path.
    * **Steam**: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Halo The Master Chief Collection`
2. Copy the entire folder and paste it somewhere safe (e.g. your desktop)
3. Back up your saved games folder.
    * **Common**: `C:\Users\<YourName>\AppData\LocalLow\MCC`

**WARNING** - Keep note of the above folder locations if you plan on installing mods manually!

## Modding Restrictions
There are some restrictions and things we want to note regarding modding in Halo: MCC.

* Mods **cannot be used in online matchmaking**. Only use mods in **Custom Games** or **Campaign**.
* You must **launch the game in modded mode** for most mods to take effect.
* Using mods in anti-cheat-enabled sessions may result in bans. Use the **"Play Halo: MCC Anti-Cheat Disabled"** option from Steam when launching the game to avoid issues.

## Where To Download Mods
The main hubs for downloading MCC mods are [Steam Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/app/976730/workshop/) and [Nexus Mods](https://www.nexusmods.com/games/halothemasterchiefcollection).

Other sources:
* [ModDB - MCC](https://www.moddb.com/games/halo-the-master-chief-collection)

**NOTE** - Always read the mod description and instructions before installing!

## Using The Steam Workshop (Recommended)
If you're running Halo: MCC through Steam, there is a very easy way to find, download, and install mods. This way is using the [Steam Workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/app/976730/workshop/).

To install mods from the workshop, follow these steps.

1. Log into Steam's community (either through the Steam application itself or through Steam's website).
2. Go to the Halo: MCC [workshop](https://steamcommunity.com/app/976730/workshop/) page.
3. Find a mod that you like, open the mod's page, and make sure it is compatible.
4. Install the mod by clicking the green **+ Subscribe** button.
5. Launch Halo: MCC with the anti-cheat disabled and enjoy the new mods!

## Using Vortex
[Vortex](https://www.nexusmods.com/about/vortex/) can be used for basic mod installations but is not widely used in the MCC community. Using the Steam Workshop is preferred due to its simplicity.

### Installing Vortex
Here are steps you can perform to download and install Vortex.

1. Download Vortex from [here](https://www.nexusmods.com/site/mods/1?tab=files).
    * Unless if you're a premium user, you will need to choose the **slow download** option.
2. Run the installer.
    * **Windows**: Ensure you have [.NET Desktop Runtime 6](https://aka.ms/dotnet/6.0/windowsdesktop-runtime-win-x64.exe) installed!
    * Vortex may prompt and guide you on fixing issues.
3. Now go to the **Games**  tab.
4. Either find Halo: MCC from the **Unmanaged** list of games or search for it in the search box at the top.
5. Click the **Manage** button located in the middle of the Halo: MCC game card.
6. This will attempt to add support for the game.
    * If Vortex has issues finding the game's location, follow the below steps:
        1. Go to the **Games** tab through Vortex.
        2. Find the game card under the **Managed** list.
        3. Click the **three dots** button located to the top-right of the card.
        4. Click **Manually Set Location**.
        5. Select the location of your game install.
    * Ensure you see the game's section in the left sidebar. If not, click the **Activate** button under the game card.

Vortex should now be configured and installed for modding Halo: MCC!

### Installing Mods
Since Vortex should be installed now, you can install mods by performing the following steps.

1. Ensure you're logged into your Nexus Mods account through Vortex.
    * You can click the **Login** button at the top-right of the application if not.
3. Go to the mod's page you want to install on Nexus Mods' website.
4. If Vortex is supported, you'll see a **Vortex** button next to the **Manual** button on the right side. Click this button.
    * If you don't see a Vortex button, it means the mod is **not supported** through Vortex and you'll need to **manually install** the mod (instructions included below).
5. Choose what download type you want (e.g., slow download).
6. The file should open in Vortex automatically and start downloading.
    * Go to the **Downloads** tab through Vortex to check the progress!
7. The mod should be automatically installed.
    * You can go to the **Mods** tab under the Halo: MCC section in the left sidebar to confirm if the mod is loaded.
    * You can remove mods by clicking the **Remove** button located on the right side of the mod item.

The mod should now be loaded the next time you launch Halo: MCC!

**NOTE** - This method only works for certain MCC mods, such as reshades or simple map replacements. For campaign or overhaul mods, use another method.

## Manual Mod Installation
If you need to install the mod manually, you may follow the below steps.

1. Download and extract the mod with [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/) or WinRAR.
2. Navigate to your MCC install directory.
    * **Steam**: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Halo The Master Chief Collection`
3. Locate the correct game folder (e.g., `haloreach`, `haloce`, `halo3`, etc.).
4. Inside the mod folder, youâ€™ll often see a path like below.
    * `\halo3\maps`
    * `\haloreach\campaign`
5. Replace or add the modded files into the appropriate subfolder.

## Disabling Anti-Cheat When Launching Halo: MCC
Disabling anti-cheat before playing Halo: MCC **allows mods to load properly**. In most cases, there is no need to enable anti-cheat when playing with mods in Halo: MCC.

To ensure 

1. Open Steam.
2. Right-click **Halo: The Master Chief Collection**.
3. Click the **properties** button.
4. Under **Launch Options**, there should be a setting called **Selected Launch Option**.
5. Either select *Ask when starting the game* or select the below option.
    * **"Play Halo: MCC Anti-Cheat Disabled (Mods and Limited Services)"**

In most cases, *Ask when starting the game* is selected by default and you'll just need to make sure to disable anti-cheat when it asks you before launching.

## Conclusion
By now, you should have a basic understanding in downloading and installing mods through Halo: MCC. We've also went through using Steam Workshop, using Vortex, and using manual installations.

Modding Halo: MCC opens the door to custom campaigns, visual enhancements, and community maps. Just remember to keep it offline!
